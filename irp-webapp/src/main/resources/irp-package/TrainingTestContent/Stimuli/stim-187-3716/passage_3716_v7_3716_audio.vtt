This presentation is from the 2013 website

00:04.036 --> 00:07.031
for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.469
this organization is more
commonly known as NASA.

00:10.547 --> 00:13.880
NASA studies space
exploration and travel.

00:14.010 --> 00:18.984
In this presentation several students
discuss the process of recycling water,

00:19.062 --> 00:23.776
and why this is important for NASA
astronauts to do while in space.

00:23.826 --> 00:28.295
Listen to the presentation, and then
answer the questions that follow.

00:28.969 --> 00:30.235
RJ:

00:30.569 --> 00:33.413
Hi I'm RJ with another NASA Fact.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.856
Did you know astronauts will
recycle water in space?

00:37.250 --> 00:38.219
Speaker 2:

00:38.813 --> 00:42.581
I understand we can recycle
newspapers but water?

00:42.897 --> 00:43.975
RJ:

00:44.228 --> 00:47.103
Nature already recycles water on earth

00:47.128 --> 00:49.734
in the water cycle, rain falls,

00:49.759 --> 00:53.640
evaporates back into the atmosphere,
and falls as rain again.

00:53.991 --> 00:57.007
Cities even recycle water
that goes down the drain.

00:57.197 --> 01:00.088
It is collected cleaned and reused.

01:00.184 --> 01:01.372
Speaker 2:

01:01.575 --> 01:05.216
That makes sense, but how can
astronauts recycle water?

01:05.488 --> 01:06.488
RJ:

01:06.909 --> 01:11.159
NASA is working on a water recycling
system for long trips to Mars.

01:11.397 --> 01:14.381
They could never carry enough
fresh water for this trip.

01:14.669 --> 01:19.466
Water will be collected from activities
like washing hands, and brushing teeth.

01:19.597 --> 01:21.472
It is cleaned and used again.

01:21.707 --> 01:25.363
Even sweat and urine will
be collected and recycled.

01:25.635 --> 01:26.760
Speaker 2:

01:27.076 --> 01:30.279
You mean they will drink
this recycled water?

01:30.310 --> 01:31.294
RJ:

01:31.547 --> 01:32.547
Don't worry,

01:32.688 --> 01:36.297
NASA will make sure this water
is cleaner than your tap water.

01:36.322 --> 01:39.010

01:39.203 --> 01:43.237
Until next time, I'm RJ
with another cool NASA fact.
