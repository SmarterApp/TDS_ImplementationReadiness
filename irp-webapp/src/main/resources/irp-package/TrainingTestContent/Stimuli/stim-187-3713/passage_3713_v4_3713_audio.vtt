In the following presentation you will
hear a speaker discuss a debate in sports.

00:06.172 --> 00:07.188
For years,

00:07.213 --> 00:12.812
sports enthusiasts have debated which
activities can be called sports

00:12.843 --> 00:17.393
 versus which should be regarded
as games or forms of art.

00:17.503 --> 00:21.503
Supporters of limiting the
use of the word “sport”

00:21.553 --> 00:26.787
claim that to be a sport an activity
must be measured quantitatively.

00:26.831 --> 00:30.021
For example, they
consider soccer a sport

00:30.046 --> 00:34.031
because the winner is determined
by the number of goals scored.

00:34.206 --> 00:35.644
In contrast,

00:35.803 --> 00:38.944
they do not classify
figure skating as a sport

00:39.038 --> 00:43.397
since judges give scores based
on personal evaluation.

00:44.029 --> 00:47.076
Therein lies a contradiction, however.

00:47.154 --> 00:52.701
One cannot call skiing a sport when
it involves a timed downhill race,

00:52.798 --> 00:57.236
and then call it something else in
a competition of aerial tricks.

00:57.445 --> 00:58.664
Moreover,

00:58.742 --> 01:03.273
golf depends upon the quantitative measurement
of strokes to determine a winner.

01:03.682 --> 01:09.109
However, the people in favor of limiting
what activities can be called sports

01:09.175 --> 01:11.238
do not consider golf a sport.

01:11.741 --> 01:17.944
Maybe the term “sport” should be defined as
any activity that is based on competition,

01:18.047 --> 01:21.972
thereby eliminating restrictions
based on the method

01:22.050 --> 01:24.066
 with which winners are determined.

01:24.375 --> 01:29.156
Without the competition, it’s just
a display of physical talent.

01:29.438 --> 01:33.969
The heart of sports, after all,
is the fight to be the best.
